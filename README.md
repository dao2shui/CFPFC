The code for paper:The causal, force perception and their perceived asymmetry in flight collisions.

The present study was to investigate causal perception and force perception in ecological objects. 
Four experiments were designed to compare the perceived causality and force of one of the two objects on the other 
by changing the property of one or both of the objects involved in the launching effect.
